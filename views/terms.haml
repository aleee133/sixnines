  "Six nines" is what service
  %a{href: 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability'} availability
  is called when it is equal to
  %strong 99.9999%
  (one mistake per a million attempts).
  To claim such a
  high availability we have to make at least a million measurements,
  which will take at least two years if we measure every minute.
  SixNines is providing such a long-term service for
  small and medium websites, which can't afford bigger enterprise-size
  solutions.
